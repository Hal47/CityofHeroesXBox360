This is a Autohotkey script to allow a XBox 360 joystick to be used in City of Heroes.

Download and install [autohotkeys](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

Start up the game, hit the keys: `LShift + Alt + b` and it will automatically start binding the right keys needed.

The following list is incomplete, but the basic idea is:
```
A - Jump
Start => Mouse click
Right Bumper Tap => Select target
Left Bumper Tap => Select teammate
Right Thumb Tap => Map

#Row 1
X => Row 1 #1
Y => Row 1 #2
B => Row 1 #3
Hold X => Row 1 #4
Hold Y => Row 1 #5
Hold B => Row 1 #6
Left Thumb Tap => Row 1 #7
Left Thumb Hold => Row 1 #8
Right Thumb Hold => Row 1 #9

#Row 2
Left Bumper + X => Row 2 #1
Left Bumper + Y => Row 2 #2
Left Bumper + B => Row 2 #3
Left Bumper + Hold X => Row 2 #4
Left Bumper + Hold Y => Row 2 #5
Left Bumper + Hold B => Row 2 #6
Left Bumper + Left Thumb Tap => Row 2 #7
Left Bumper + Left Thumb Hold => Row 2 #8
Left Bumper + Right Thumb Hold => Row 2 #9

#Row 3
Left Trigger + X => Row 3 #1
Left Trigger + Y => Row 3 #2
Left Trigger + B => Row 3 #3
Left Trigger + Hold X => Row 3 #4
Left Trigger + Hold Y => Row 3 #5
Left Trigger + Hold B => Row 3 #6
Left Trigger + Left Thumb Tap => Row 3 #7
Left Trigger + Left Thumb Hold => Row 3 #8
Left Trigger + Right Thumb Hold => Row 3 #9

Right Bumper + X => Edurance Insp
Right Bumper + Y => Acc Insp
Right Bumper + B => Dmg Insp
Right Bumper + A => Health Insp

Right Trigger + Y => Exits mission
Right Trigger + A => Selects OK in dialogs
Right Trigger + B => Selects No in dialogs

#MM Controls (To be updated soon.)
Left Trigger + Left Bumper + X => Defends Mode
Left Trigger + Left Bumper + Y => Goto
Left Trigger + Left Bumper + B => Attacks Target
Left Trigger + Left Bumper + DPad UP => Selects MM Boss
Left Trigger + Left Bumper + DPad LEFT => Selects MM Mids
Left Trigger + Left Bumper + DPad RIGHT => Selects all
Left Trigger + Left Bumper + DPad DOWN => Selects MM Minions

```

The list is incomplete and needs some updates or may be different, but this is the gist. I'd be up for some collaboration in making this better, but it's very fun to play with joystick in this setup. Especially with MM archtypes.
